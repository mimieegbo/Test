 <p>This <b>Lorem Ipsum</b> is <b>bold</b> simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.</p>
 <hr>
<p> Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,</p>
<p id="bquote"> when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.</p>
<p> It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining</p> essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset
<p id="special_tag"> sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software</p>
<p> like Aldus PageMaker including versions of <a href="./another.html">Lorem Ipsum.</a></p>
